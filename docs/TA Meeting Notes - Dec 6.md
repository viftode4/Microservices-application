# TA Meeting 06.12.2022

## Week 3 Performance Feedback
    Need to start coding this week

## Assignment 1 (Dec 13) Requirements
    - A UML Diagram
        - Include description and justification of design choices

    - The design patterns
        - Need at least 2 different design patterns
        - Create UML diagram for each design pattern
        - Justify why we used these design patterns

## Diagram Feedback
    - Consider splitting the contract microservice up
    - Include the location of the notification/email system that we use
    - Where is the request of the user?
        - Consider including a requests microservice
    - Need to convert this into a proper UML diagram
    - Microservices should have seperate databases (if it is needed for the microservice)
        - Do not have one database that all microservices access
    - For report consider writing in Latex otherwise TA will be sad :(

## Testing
    - Use knowledge from SQT
        - Unit testing
        - Integration testing
            - Minimum should be within the microservice
            - Mocking should be enough for full points for testing
        - Functional testing
            - Create tests specific for the must haves
            - Ideally have a user story, but is not required
        - Good testing coverage
            - Aim for 80%

## This week plan
    - Wednesday 7th Metting 18:00 to divide up the work/making issues
    - Saturday 10th Meeting for Assignment 1
